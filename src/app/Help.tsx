                The graph is interactive: clicking on a category will filter the genes in the right
                panel to only show genes in that category, and recalculate the graph based on the

                <span className="font-bold">MF</span> will toggle between showing/hiding GO
                molecular function terms. This will not change the list of genes in the right panel,

              <li className="text-gray-700">
                The categories are high level GO terms (GO subsets) that categorize the exact GO
                terms that are annotated in the right panel. In most cases they represent a broader
                concept compared to the exact annotations shown in the right panel (the relationship
                is shown on the gene details page).

              <li className="text-gray-700">
                You can filter by multiple categories, for example to find all genes with "protein
                kinase activity" that function in the "cytosol", or all genes with both "unknown
                molecular function" and "unknown biological process".

                If you don't find a gene in an expected category, it may be in a more specific
                category instead. Each gene is assigned to the most specific category possible, in
                order to minimize overlap between categories.
