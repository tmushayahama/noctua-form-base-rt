            The PAN-GO functionome is designed to be as accurate and comprehensive as possible,
            while also being concise (a minimally redundant set of GO terms for each gene). To
            create PAN-GO, we have integrated all available annotations in the GO knowledgebase,
            which were drawn from experimental results reported in about 175,000 scientific
            publications. The set of PAN-GO annotations refers to evidence from more than 56,000 of
            these publications that provided the most direct and relevant data. Despite the large
            number of publications reviewed in this version, the PAN-GO functionome may be missing
            some functional characteristics that have been experimentally verified, and we encourage
            the scientific community to{' '}
